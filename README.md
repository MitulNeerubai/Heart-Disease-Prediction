# Heart Disease Prediction Project

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict heart disease in patients based on their medical attributes. The project involves exploring various health-related features and applying machine learning algorithms to build a robust prediction system. Additionally, a comprehensive dashboard was created using Power BI and Tableau to visualize the results and key metrics from the prediction model.

### Dataset
The dataset contains information about several medical parameters, with the target variable being the presence or absence of heart disease. The features in the dataset include:

Age: Age of the patient

Sex: Gender of the patient (1 = Male, 0 = Female)

Chest Pain Type: Type of chest pain experienced by the patient

Resting Blood Pressure: Blood pressure measured when the patient is at rest

Cholesterol Level: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl

Fasting Blood Sugar: Blood sugar level

Resting Electrocardiographic Results: ECG results

Maximum Heart Rate Achieved: The maximum heart rate achieved during exercise

Exercise Induced Angina: Whether the patient experienced angina (chest pain) during exercise

Old Peak: Depression induced by exercise relative to rest

Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment

Ca: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy

Thalassemia: Type of thalassemia

Target: 1 if the patient has heart disease, 0 otherwise

### Project Steps
#### 1. Data Preprocessing
Loaded the dataset and explored its structure.

Handled any missing values or incorrect data entries.

Converted categorical variables (like sex and chest pain type) into numerical format to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.

#### 2. Feature Selection
Performed correlation analysis and feature importance analysis to identify the most relevant features for the prediction model.

Removed irrelevant or highly correlated features to enhance the model’s performance.

#### 3. Model Building
Split the data into training and testing sets.

Applied various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression to train the model.

Evaluated the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

#### 4. Model Evaluation and Tuning
Evaluated the model’s performance on unseen test data to validate its generalizability.

Performed hyperparameter tuning and model optimization to improve prediction accuracy and performance.

#### 5. Dashboard Creation Using Power BI
Built a dashboard using Power BI to visualize the results and key metrics of the heart disease prediction.

Used DAX commands to calculate and create meaningful measures such as total number of heart disease cases, average cholesterol levels, and trends over time.

Created various visualizations including funnel charts, KPIs, and trend lines to help stakeholders understand the key insights from the dataset.

#### 6. Dashboard Creation Using Tableau
Also developed a similar dashboard using Tableau, incorporating various visualization techniques to display the prediction results.

Designed interactive charts, including pie charts, line graphs, and heatmaps, to explore the relationship between various health parameters and heart disease prediction.



### Conclusion
This project involved building a predictive model for heart disease using machine learning algorithms, followed by the creation of a comprehensive and interactive dashboard using both Power BI and Tableau. The dashboards provide valuable insights into the data and the prediction results, making it easier to understand trends and key metrics such as cholesterol levels, age distribution, and other health indicators related to heart disease.

Through this project, you will learn how to preprocess data, apply machine learning models, and visualize data effectively using Power BI and Tableau, gaining hands-on experience in both data science and business intelligence tools.
